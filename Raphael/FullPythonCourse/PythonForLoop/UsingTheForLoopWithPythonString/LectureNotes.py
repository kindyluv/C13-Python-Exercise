# Strings are iterable objects, they contain a set of characters.

# Example
# Suppose we want to print out each character in a string individually.
# You could do so using the for loop:
# Example 1: Print out each letter in the string

string = "banana"

for letter in string:
    print(letter)

# You can add a break statement and a continue statement.
# A break statement stops a loop
