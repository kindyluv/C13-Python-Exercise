### VARIABLES  ###
# A variable is a container that can store data values
# variables make it a lot easier to update, manipulate or use our data values in our program
# A variable can only store one value at a time

# Variable Declaration and Assignment #

# SyntaxðŸ‘‰: variable name = value e.g.

name = 'Raphael King'
print(name)
name = 'Angela'
print(name)

age = 25
print(age)

phoneNumber = '09093987491'
print(phoneNumber)

# your_name = input("please enter your name? ")
# print(your_name)

name = input("what is your name?")
length = len(name)
print(length)

# Rules For Naming Variables #
# 1. Use meaningful variable names
# 2. if a name contains two words, separate it with an underscore e.g. full_name.
# 3. You can't have spaces in variable names
# 4. You can have a number anywhere in your variable name, except at the beginning e.g. length1 (1length is invalid variable name)


## Declaring Multiple Variables In A Single Declaration ##

# width, height = 400, 500
# print(width)
# print(height)


# Example 2:
print(input("enter name: ") + ', how are you')
