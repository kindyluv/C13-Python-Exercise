#   round() function
# Use round() to round off a decimal number.
# Syntax: round(number, ndigits)
    print(round(8/3))

# float division //
    print(8 // 3)

# When you save the result of a calculation into a variable, you can continue to perform calculations on the variable.

# Example 1:
result = 8 / 2
result /= 2
print(result)

score = 0
score += 1 # takes the previous version of score and add one to it
print(score)

# You can also use -=, *=, and /=

# F-STRINGS
# It's a more convenient way to combine strings and other data types. It eliminates the use of concatenation sign (+)

# Example 1:
score = 0
height = 1.8
isWinning = True

print(f"your score is {score}, your height is {height}, you are winning is {isWinning}")
