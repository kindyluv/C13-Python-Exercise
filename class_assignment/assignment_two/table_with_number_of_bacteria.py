# Starting with 200 bacteria, the growth in the
# number of bacteria after n hours is calculated as follows: B = 200 Ã— 2n. Print the number
# of bacteria after 0, 5, 10, and 15 hours in table format as shown below. Use the tab escape
# sequence to achieve the two-column output.
# Hour     Number of Bacteria
#    0 				200
