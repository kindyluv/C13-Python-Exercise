8. (Triangles) In an equilateral triangle, the lengths of all three sides are equal. Consequently,
it is also equiangular with all three internal angles congruent to each other and
measuring 60Â°. Write a script where a user can input the length of the three sides of a triangle.
The script should determine if it is an equilateral triangle or not.
